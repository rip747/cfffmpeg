#CFFFMPEG

A port of the [FFMPEG](https://github.com/polly/ffmpeg) DSL Ruby library to CFML.

##Why

1. FFMpeg is the standard for converting video and audio to different formats on the web. It's a shame that we don't have a native interface to this great tool and have to rely on execute and hacks to work with it. By creating a native DSL that anyone can use, it will hopefully make this great tool easier and to work with.
2. A DSL also allows us to add aditional methods to make converting videos to popular format as simple as calling a method.
3. I never wrote a DSL before and I thought that this would make for an interesting project.

##How to use

Simple unzip the zip file into a directory that your CFML engine can access (for argument's sake, we'll use lib/cfffmpeg).

Next create the cfffmpeg object using createobject().

Once created you can then use the dsl.

###Convert a WMV file to MPEG1

    <cfset source = expandPath("vids/test1.wmv")>
    <cfset target = expandPath("vids/test1.mpg")>
    <cfset ffmpeg = createobject("component", "lib.cfffmpeg.cfffmpeg").init()>
    <cfset cmd = ffmpeg.convert(source, target).target("ntsc-vcd").end()>
    
##Return Data

CFFFMpeg will return a structure contain the following keys:

* success (boolean) - tells whether errors have occurred.
* logfile (string) - the entire log output the is generated by ffmpeg. good for determining what the error was.
* command (string) - the actually ffmpeg command that is generated and run against the environment.

##Thanks and credits

I want to thank Patrik Hedman (polly) who wrote the ffmpeg DSL for Ruby which this project is a port of and inspired by.

I also want to thank [CFSearching](http://cfsearching.blogspot.com) whose posts about using ffmpeg with CFML were invaluable to getting this project done as I copied most of the processing code from his post :)

##Enhancements and Bug Fixes
If you have issues please report them in the bug tracker.

I am NOT taking enhancment request for this project. If you have a feature that you would like to add, fork the project, add the feature yourself and submit a pull request back. I have too many other projects that I'm already working on and I do not have the time to devote this one.
